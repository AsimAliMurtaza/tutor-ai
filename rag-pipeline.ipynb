      "Based on the provided context, it appears that the author, Kuroko, is an expert in networking and has a deep understanding of various aspects of the field. Here are some key points that can be inferred about his future predictions for networking and the internet:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mobile Health**: The author mentions mobile health as a diverse problem domain with challenges in defining problems correctly, iterating between design and deployment, prototyping, and piloting. This suggests that he expects significant advancements in mobile health technology in the future.\n",
      "2. **Wireless Networks and Mobility**: The author predicts that we may see the end of feature phones, which are non-programmable devices used only for voice and text messaging. Instead, he expects widespread adoption of smartphones with advanced features like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n",
      "3. **IoT and Embedded Systems**: The author notes that many IoT devices use embedded WiFi and other lower-power connectivity methods to connect to local hubs. He also mentions a large consumer wearables market and interactive voice agents like Siri and Alexa, which may continue to grow in popularity.\n",
      "4. **Data and Analytics Dominance**: Architecture is shifting from layer 4 and below (i.e., applications on top of transport layers) to data and analytics dominance, where data plays a central role.\n",
      "5. **Named Data and Software-Defined Networking**: The author highlights the efforts towards named data and software-defined networking as a way to create more manageable, evolvable, and richer infrastructure. This suggests that he expects significant advancements in these areas.\n",

      "Overall, Kuroko's predictions indicate that networking will continue to evolve rapidly, with an increasing focus on data-driven decision making, advanced applications like mobile health and IoT, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning into various aspects of network architecture and operation.\n",
